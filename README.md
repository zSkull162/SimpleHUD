## Info:
SimpleHUD is a HUD system I made for VRChat, because I wanted to make my own system that was easy to customize, had nice clean UI, and motion smoothing. So here it is! Free for anyone to use in their projects, and should be very simple to customize to your liking.

## Important:
This system was developed and tested on Unity 2022.3.6. It may or may not work on Unity 2019.4.31, and it should work fine on Unity 2022.3.22, but I have not tested.

## Features:
Within this package, I include prefabs for a simple version, and an "extra" version. Each prefab includes a UI menu to change the HUD's options in-game, or you can use the No-UI prefab variants. To change the default settings, refer to the bottom paragraph.

The "simple" version of the HUD system includes the HUD canvas, and one parent object for the text. The "extra" version of the prefab includes top, bottom, left, and right side text parents. This can be seen in the [Preview video](https://youtu.be/gmYI42rgkzo) linked here and at the top of this ReadMe.

By default, the HUD's options may not be what you prefer. To change the default settings; If you use a prefab with UI, enter playmode, change the sliders to your liking, exit playmode, and set the slider's values to what they were in playmode. If you're using a No-UI prefab, customize the UI version if the prefab, change the sldiers to your liking, exit playmode and select the "HUD Default Settings" object in the No-UI prefab, and in the inspector, change the values to what you had changed in the UI prefab. After the values are set, you can delete the UI prefab version.
