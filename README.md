## Info:
SimpleHUD is a HUD system I made for VRChat, because I wanted to make my own system that was easy to customize, had nice clean UI, and motion smoothing. So here it is! Free for anyone to use in their projects, and should be very simple to customize to your liking.

## Important:
This system was developed and tested on Unity 2022.3.6. It may or may not work on Unity 2019.4.31, and it should work fine on Unity 2022.3.22, but I have not tested.

## Features:
Within this package, I include prefabs for a simple version, and an "extra" version. Each prefab includes a UI menu to change the HUD's options in-game, which you may leave enabled or not. (Note: Currently there's no way to set the HUD's default position in-editor, so if you don't want HUD settings, you may want to hide the menu, and set the slider's default values.)

By default, the HUD's options may not be what you prefer. (For now) to change the HUD's default settings, I reccommend you enter Playmode with Clientsim, set-up the sliders with your preferred options, write down what each slider's value is, then exit exit mode and type in each value for the sliders and reset buttons. For the future, I may add a script which lets you change the default values in-editor without having to type it for the sliders and reset buttons manually.
